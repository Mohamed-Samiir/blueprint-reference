/**
 * Two-pane auth layout: a full-height brand panel beside the form area. The form
 * is a child route rendered into `<router-outlet />` — the layout never knows
 * which form it is showing.
 *
 * Responsive across the whole range — the panes are `flex`, the brand panel is
 * `hidden md:flex` (so below `md` the form pane is the whole viewport) and grows
 * `md:w-1/2 lg:w-3/5`; the form pane is `min-w-0` and scrolls vertically when
 * the viewport is short. Tailwind breakpoints only, tokens only.
