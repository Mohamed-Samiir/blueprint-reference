/**
 * Single centered card. The form is a child route rendered into
 * `<router-outlet />`.
 *
 * Uses the same backgrounds as the split layout — page `bg-background`, the card
 * container (`hlmCard` → `bg-card`), and the fields (spartan `hlmInput` /
 * `hlm-input-group`) all match. Responsive at every width: `px-4 sm:px-6` keeps
 * the card off the edges, the page scrolls vertically when short, the card is
 * `w-full max-w-sm`.
